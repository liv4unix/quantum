The perfect swap test is *imperfect* in the presence of noise, since it assumes fully calibrated quantum hardware. Since noise on hardware oscillates on the order of 10 minutes, it becomes difficult to perfectly calibrate $CZ$ gates everywhere; consequently, the incorrectly calibrated perfect swap test will likely converge to an incorrect state. An approach robust to incorrect noise models is helpful to learn variational circuits. Since the EQ-GAN has a Nash equilibrium at the location of a calibrated swap test, we expect it to properly converge.\n",

Realistic single-qubit phase noise is estimated from Fig. S2 of Google's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07965) on Fermi-Hubbard dynamics, and we set the two-qubit controlled phase error to zero. Experimentally, the two-qubit controlled phase error is much smaller than the single-qubit phase error, so this assumption is realistic."

As with classical GANs, the quantum GAN naturally drifts away from the converged state after it has been obtained due to a vanishing gradient. To identify where the converged state is, we examine the loss function and select the lowest discriminator loss (dashed line)."
